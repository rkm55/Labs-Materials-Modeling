	abstract = {We present two dimensional molecular dynamics simulations of grain boundary migration using the half-loop bicrystal geometry in the experiments of Shvindlerman et al. We examine the dependence of steady-state grain boundary migration rate on grain boundary curvature by varying the half-loop width at constant temperature. The results confirm the classical result derived by absolute reaction rate theory that grain boundary velocity is proportional to the curvature. We then measure the grain boundary migration rate for fixed half-loop width at varying temperatures. Analysis of this data establishes an Arrhenius relation between the grain boundary mobility and temperature, allowing us to extract the activation energy for grain boundary migration. Since grain boundaries have an excess volume, curvature driven grain boundary migration increases the density of the system during the simulations. In simulations performed at constant pressure, this leads to vacancy generation during the boundary migration, making the whole migration process jerky.},

The algorithm considers the preliminary correction of the parameter values in accordance with the required cutoff radius of the potential. The initial data and calculation results for α Fe, Cr, V, Mo, α W, Al, Ni, and Cu are given. Using the obtained values of the potential, values of the energy of formation of a vacancy for the sim ulated equilibrium crystal structures of pure substances are calculated that comply with the published data.},

	abstract = {Current research on grain boundary migration in metals is reviewed. For individual grain boundaries the dependence of grain boundary migration on misorientation and impurity content are addressed. Impurity drag theory, extended to include the interaction of adsorbed impurities in the boundary, reasonably accounts quantitatively for the observed concentration dependence of grain boundary mobility. For the first time an experimental study of triple junction motion is presented. The kinetics are quantitatively discussed in terms of a triple junction mobility. Their impact on the kinetics of microstructure evolution during grain growth is outlined.},

	abstract = {We investigate the application of embedded atom method (EAM) interatomic potentials in the study of crystallization kinetics from deeply undercooled melts, focusing on the fcc metals Al and Cu. For this application, it is important that the EAM potential accurately reproduces melting properties and liquid structure, in addition to the crystalline properties most commonly fit in its development. To test the accuracy of previously published EAM potentials and to guide the development of new potential in this work, first-principles calculations have been performed and new experimental measurements of the Al and Cu liquid structure factors have been undertaken by X-ray diffraction. We demonstrate that the previously published EAM potentials predict a liquid structure that is too strongly ordered relative to measured diffraction data. We develop new EAM potentials for Al and Cu to improve the agreement with the first-principles and measured liquid diffraction data. Furthermore, we calculate liquid-phase diffusivities and find that this quantity correlates well with the liquid structure. Finally, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of crystal nucleation from the melt during quenching at constant cooling rate. We find that EAM potentials, which predict the same zero-temperature crystal properties but different liquid structures, can lead to quite different crystallization kinetics. More interestingly, we find that two potentials predicting very similar equilibrium solid and liquid properties can still produce very different crystallization kinetics under far-from-equilibrium conditions characteristic of the rapid quenching simulations employed here.},
