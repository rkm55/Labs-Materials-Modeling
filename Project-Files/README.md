# Materials Modeling Project

This README file contains some information about the required modeling project for the course.

The project has the following expected outcomes:
  * Chance to learn try out a modeling technique on a problem of interest to you
  * Learn how to validate a modeling technique to ensure meaningful results and understand the limitations of the selected technique
  * Learn to interpret results in the context of your modeling approach and its limitations as well as that of the literature to which the work contributes

Here is a brief list of past projects:


  * Atomistic simulations of grain boundary mobility
  * Atomistic simulations of deformation in a polycrystal
  * Finite element - KMC simulations of deformation in a metallic glass
  * Phase stability of a material using cluster expansion
  * Potts model simulation of microstructure evolution
  * Machine learning using a grain boundary metric of similarity
  * Molecular modeling of MEMS spring
    
As part of the project you'll be required to turn in the following assignments (due dates listed on [Learning Suite](https://learningsuite.byu.edu)):

  1. Initial overview of problem (recommended that you turn in a draft of your introduction section)
      1. You must discuss the project with me
      2. Keep project conservative
      3. Can be new to you but already published in the literature, IF a complete description is NOT published.
  2. Planned methods (this can but doesn't have to be a draft of your methods section)
      1. Make sure your planned methods includes a good overview description of the goal and general approach.
      2. Also include detailed lists/steps of each part so that you can convince yourself (and me) that you have a good idea of all the steps that will be necessary.
      3. Keep the planned methods/project simple; most students like to think of a whole research paper with lots of tests to fully understand their problem. I would love to see you be able to do that, but my goal is actually smaller. I want you to convince yourself (and me) that you can identify and validate a modeling technique and that you can test whether your method will allow you to get at the problem of interest by applying it to one or two conditions. If you can get that far, you will be able to extend what you've done to the rest of the problem you're interested in researching.
  3. Initial results (this can but doesn't have to be a draft of your validation, results, and, if possible, discussion sections)
      1. A list of all the steps you think you'll need to follow to complete your project; bulleted list is recommended for clarity, I don't care if it is long. This should include steps to validate your model and what tests you'll run to get results for analysis and discussion.
      2. Clearly identify which of the steps have been completed, which are in process, and which have not been started. 
      3. For validation and results obtained, provide a brief overview of what you have found and how that will inform your next steps.
  4. Presentation
  5. Final report using the overall layout listed in this file (minus this descriptive text in the introduction and other examples of how to add a figure and table.)

  Note: You may receive extra credit if your report is of sufficient quality to be submitted to a journal. But this is a significant investment of time and effort, only 1 person has done it in 3 semesters.

## Paper Organization

If you have questions about the best practices to follow when writing a paper like this, I recommend reading documents about the [IMRaD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMRAD) organizational structure. The BYU Mechanical Engineering Department also has documentation about how to write the various sections of IMRaD in this [BYU ME Writing Materials](http://me.byu.edu/resources) link. In particular, I expect your figures and tables to follow the instructions listed in the BYU writing link. Use the following format

1. Introduction
2. Background
    1. Scientific Principle of Interest
    2. Modeling techniques used to solve the problem
3. Methods
4. Validation
5. Results
6. Discussion (Meaning of what you found)
7. Conclusions
    1. Including lessons learned and future improvements that could be implemented


## Latex Template

You **must** use the sections listed above, and illustrated in the Latex Document found in the template folder, but you do not have to use LaTeX to write your report. If you do wish to use LaTeX and you are new to this, I recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). Overleaf has a great guide to \LaTeX{} and tips on formatting in their [Documentation](https://www.overleaf.com/learn). To use the template in Overleaf, create a new project, upload the files, and then recompile whenever you want to see the latest PDF of your manuscript. In the template I have listed examples of how to use lists, equations, figures, and tables. New paragraphs can be obtained by having an extra line in between lines of text.
