# Random Walk Assignment


In this assignment, we will use a random series of jumps, and even a number of different trajectories of random series of jumps to examine the random walk model. Some of this assignment will take place on MATLAB Grader and the remainder can be carried out in MATLAB on your computer. The Learner Templates are available in the GITHUB repository.

_Note: You must use some specific functions like **randi** and code the jump sequence according to **Eq. 2.18.**_

1.	(10 pts) Write a function that will return an updated position and jump vector. 
    * Complete this problem on MATLAB Grader.
    * **In the LS PDF, include a statement indicating what fraction of the tests you were able to complete on MATLAB Grader in the allowed attempts for credit.**

2.	(10 pts) Write a function that will return updated position, squared displacement, and jump vectors for a series of jumps.
    * Complete this problem on MATLAB Grader.
    * **In the LS PDF, include a statement indicating what fraction of the tests you were able to complete on MATLAB Grader in the allowed attempts for credit.**

3.	(10 pts) Write a function that will return updated position and squared displacements for a series of jumps for a number of different trajectories. Return also the mean square displacement as a function of the series of jumps.
    * Complete this problem on MATLAB Grader.
    * **In the LS PDF, include a statement indicating what fraction of the tests you were able to complete on MATLAB Grader in the allowed attempts for credit.**

    Use the code developed for problems 1-3 to do the following. Place all the graphs and discussion in the PDF file that will be uploaded to Learning Suite.  *Note: Before continuing I highly recommend playing with the `P3_test_randomJumpSeriesTrajectories.m` function to see how things change with the number of jumps and trajectories.*


4.	(10 pts) Problem on the diffusion coefficient is coming.

5.	(10 pts) Problem on the end-to-end probability distribution is coming.
