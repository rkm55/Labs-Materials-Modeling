## Getting Started Tutorial assignment

Complete the following parts and upload the relevant details in a PDF to be submitted to Learning Suite.

1.	Request a supercomputing account if you don't already have one (to be used later in the course):
    *	<https://rc.byu.edu/account/create/>
    * Try to sign up based on a course. 
    * If not request traditional account, Request Eric Homer as your faculty mentor
    * In the section that requests a reason for the supercomputing account, state the following, if needed:
        1. This account will be used to run simulations as part of a computational materials modeling course, ME 556.
    * **In the LS PDF, include a statement indicating whether you have an account or have requested an account and if it has been approved, and whether it is connected to the course.**
2.  Make sure you have access to a terminal and linux, see the following list of items to help with this.
    * If your personal machine won't work you can login to CAEDM or the supercomputer. 
        1. CAEDM Server: ssh.et.byu.edu (Access will need to be requested for non-engineering majors)
        2. Supercomputer: ssh.rc.byu.edu
    * Checkout the software list below, it can greatly simplify your workflow.
    * If you are off-campus, you can only connect to one of these machines through the [CAEDM VPN](https://caedm.et.byu.edu/wiki/index.php5?title=VPN)
    * **In the LS PDF, include a statement indicating that you have found a machine on which to run Linux terminal commmands.**
3.	Complete the following sections (Introduction,1,2,5,6,7) of this Linux/Unix Tutorial <http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/> 
    * **In the LS PDF, include a statement indicating you completed the required sections of this tutorial.**
    * **In the LS PDF, include the output from *ALL* of Section 7 of the tutorial.**
    * There is another excellent shell tutorial from [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) but it takes much longer to complete. Whether you are new to to a shell or not, it has some **really** valuable tips and tricks. You are **NOT** required to complete it but I recommend at least looking through it.
4.  Complete the [10 minute GIT Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/).
    * **In the LS PDF, include a statement indicating that you completed the GIT tutorial.**
    * Then clone the course repository located at <https://github.com/BYUMicrostructureResearch/MaterialsModelingCourse>. Note that this is a private repository so you'll need to have created a GitHub account and shared your username with me via Slack.
    * **In the LS PDF, include a statement indicating that you have successfully cloned the class repository.**
    * There is another excellent GIT tutorial from [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) but it takes much longer to complete. Whether you are new to to GIT or not, it has some valuable tips and tricks. You are **NOT** required to complete it but I recommend at least looking through it. *See note below on GIT credentials.*
5.  Complete all the Tutorials in the [MATLAB Getting Started Page](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html) (i.e. Desktop Basics through Help and Documentation)
    * **In the LS PDF, include a statement indicating that you have successfully completed all the MATLAB Tutorials.**
6.  Browse the other items, additional resources, and suggested software.
